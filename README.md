This is the list of my projects.
## Viegenere.py
This program can both encrypt and decrypt a message using the Viegenere Cipher Method. 
Inputting '0' will call the encrypt function and inputting 1 will call the decrypt function.
You can do as many encryptions or decryptions as you'd like; just keep inputting 1 after you see the results.
## Pokerd.py
This program mimicks a custom map called "Poker Defense" in starcraft, where the goal is to get the highest hand as 
possible to get strong units. In this kind of poker, 5 cards with the value of 7~A appear, and you are allowed to 
re-draw the each individual card once. Each draw is counted as a independent event; which is the reason why
five cards can appear in this program.
