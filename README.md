## Vegenere.py
This program can both encrypt and decrypt a message using the Viegenere Cipher Method. 
Inputting '0' will call the encrypt function and inputting 1 will call the decrypt function.
You can do as many encryptions or decryptions as you'd like; just keep inputting 1 after you see the results.
